Code examples without notes and with deliberately obscure function, argument and variable names to be used as code reading exercises. Each one comes with a clue in the form of a function call that can be run from the command line.

```sh
function funcOne(arg1) {
  
  ...

  return result
}

```

HT @jacksongabbard for suggesting this format
